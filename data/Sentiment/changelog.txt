CMFA PressCon v3 (15 January 2023)
- Press conferences held in 2022 were added (2561 additional question/answer dyads). Version 3 of the corpus covers the period between 15 October 2002 and 31 December 2022.
- All questions/answers dyads (raw text) were processed again using more advanced models for Natural Language Processing (NLP). For version 3, we used Trankit for POS tagging and Flair for named entity recognition. Trankit is a lightweight transformer-based Python toolkit for multilingual natural language processing (see more https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/trankit). All questions and answers were processed using XLM-Roberta-base model. 
- For named entity recognition (NER), we have used a new state-of-the-art model using the Flair library (see more https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/). The new model (ner-large) was applied to the whole dataset, so the quality of NE extraction is consistent across the corpus.
- We added a new variable, "who_asked", which maps the authors of the collected questions. MFA started publishing this information already back in 2020, but as we were not sure whether it would remain part of the transcripts, we waited for its publishing until now. The variable maps the authorship from its start back in 2020 onwards. 

CMFA PressCon v2 (1 June 2022)
- Press conferences held in 2021 were added (2896 additional question/answer dyads). Version 2 of the corpus covers the period between 15 October 2002 and 31 December 2021.
- Minor fixes considering splits of multitopical questions (better algorithm for identifying multitopical candidates). 74 questions were re-checked manually from version 1, and 43 were split into multitopical questions. All question/answer dyads from 2021 were processed with the new algorithm. 
- All questions/answers dyads (raw text) were processed again using more advanced models for Natural Language Processing (NLP). For version 2, we used Trankit instead of UPPipe. Trankit is a lightweight transformer-based Python toolkit for multilingual natural language processing (see more https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/trankit). All questions and answers were processed using XLM-Roberta-base model on a laptop with 6GB NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU (~3h of processing time). Trankit has improved the precision of lemmatization as well as provided a more straightforward way for extracting named entities (NER).
- Named entities from questions and answers were extracted using Trankit instead of AllenNLP we used in version 1 (faster; better performance). The new model was applied to the whole dataset.
- Codebook moved to a separate PDF file.

CMFA PressCon v1 (15 April 2021)
- Original version of the dataset. The repository contains the replication code for the network analysis presented in Mochtak, Michal and Richard Q. Turcsanyi (2021): "Studying Chinese Foreign Policy Narratives: Introducing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Conferences Corpus".
